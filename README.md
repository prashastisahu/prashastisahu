# Hi, I’m Prashasti 👋  

🎓 **Researcher in Communication Networks** | TU Chemnitz  
🔬 Focused on **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**, **Network Migration Planning**, and **Techno-Economic Optimization**  
💡 Exploring how AI can drive resilient, flexible, and cost-efficient optical transport networks  

---

## 🚀 Research Interests
- **Network Migration & Planning** – Migration strategies from Monolithic OTN to Disaggregated/DOTS/PLE architectures  
- **AI for Networks** – Applying DRL (PPO, DQN) and Decision Rules for capacity & migration decisions  
- **Techno-Economic Modeling** – CAPEX/OPEX analysis, NPV/ENPV optimization under uncertainty  
- **Traffic Forecasting** – Stochastic demand growth, scenario-based planning  
- **Optimization Methods** – Integer Linear Programming (ILP), Metaheuristics
